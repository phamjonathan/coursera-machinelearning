#### Question 1:

    [-7  -7 ]


    [ 1  1 ]
    [-3  -7 ]


    [ 1  -7 ]
    [-7  7 ]


    [ 1  7 ]
    [ 7  9 ]

`Answer:` 

    [ 1  -7 ]
    [-7  -7 ]

#### Question 2:

    Let x = [ 8 ]
            [ 2 ]
            [ 5 ]
            [ 1 ]
            

What is 2 * x?

    [ 16  4  10  2 ]


    [ 4 ]
    [ 1 ]
    [5/2]
    [1/2]


    [ 4  1  5/2  1/2 ]


    [ 16 ]
    [ 4 ]
    [ 10 ]
    [ 2 ]

`Answer:` 

    [ 16 ]
    [ 4 ]
    [ 10 ]
    [ 2 ]

#### Question 3:

Let u be a 3-dimensional vector, where specifically

    u = [ 5 ]
        [ 1 ]
        [ 9 ]

What is u^(t)?

    [ 5 ]
    [ 1 ]
    [ 9 ]


    [ 9  1  5 ]


    [ 9 ]
    [ 1 ]
    [ 5 ]


    [ 5  1  9 ]

`Answer:`

    [ 5  1  9 ]

#### Question 4: 

Let u and v be 3-dimensional vectors, where specifically

    u = [-3 ]
        [ 4 ]
        [ 3 ]

    and 

    v = [ 3 ]
        [ 1 ]
        [ 5 ]

What is u^(t)v?

`(Hint: u^(t) is a 1x3 dimensional matrix, and v can also be seen as a 3x1 matrix. The answer you can can be obtained by taking the matrix product of u^(t) and v.) Do not add brackets your answer.`

`Answer:` 10

#### Question 5:

Let A and B 3x3 (square) matrices. Which of the following must be necessarily hold true? Check all that apply.

    A * B * A = B * A * B 


    A * B = B * A


    A + B = B + A


    If A is the 3x3 identity matrix, then A * B = B * A

`Answers:`

    A + B = B + A

`We add matrices element-wise. So, this must be true.`

    If A is the 3x3 identity matrix, then A * B = B * A

`Even though matrix multiplication is not commutative in general ( A *  B not equal to B * A for general matrices A, B ), for the special case where A = I, we have A * B = I * B = B, and also B * A = B * I = B.. So, A * B = B * A.`
